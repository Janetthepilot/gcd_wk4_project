README
Using data from the “Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset”, provided by the project assignment, an R program called “run_analysis” was built to meet the following requirements:
* Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
This project is subject to peer review.  Review criteria are as follows:
* The submitted data set is tidy. 
* The Github repo contains the required scripts.
* GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
* The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.
* The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.
Via the “run_analysis” script, the assignment was read into R, sorted into appropriate variables, merged into one data set, and activities and data set variables were assigned more descriptive names.  Additionally, the data was updated into another data set, called “tidy_data_set” and averaged each variable for each activity and each subject.
Four files are included in this repo:
1. This README
2. The “run_analysis” script
3. A Code Book
4. The “tidy_data_set” in a text file
